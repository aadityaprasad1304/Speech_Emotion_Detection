# Speech Emotion Recognition

## Overview
This project focuses on Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict the emotional state conveyed in spoken language, which can have practical applications in various fields, including customer care centers.

## Features
- Text preprocessing: The provided dataset is preprocessed to clean and prepare the text data for training the model.
- Text vectorization: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization is used to convert the processed text into numerical features.
- Machine Learning Model: A Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier is trained on the processed text data to recognize emotions.
- Audio Input: The project includes the capability to capture live audio, transcribe it to text, and predict the emotion using the trained model.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to install the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- pyaudio
- speech_recognition

## Live Audio Testing
The project includes functionality to capture live audio, transcribe it to text, and predict the emotion using the trained model.
Adjust the audio capture parameters in the code if necessary.
The predicted emotion will be displayed in the console.
